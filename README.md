# Neovim Configuration

![dashboard](./images/dashboard.png)

![debugger](./images/debug.png)

## Introduction

This is my custom Neovim configuration with a collection of useful plugins,
keybinds and settings.

It is based off [Kickstart.Nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim),
which is a wonderful starting point for a custom configuration. The actual code
was originally forked from
[Kickstart-Modular.nvim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim),
which is a fork of the original Kickstart configuration with some changes made
to simplify the project layout.

## Installation

### Install Neovim

This configuration targets *only* the latest
['stable'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable) and latest
['nightly'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly) of Neovim.
If you are experiencing issues, please make sure you have the latest versions.

### Install External Dependencies

External Requirements:
- Basic utils: `git`, `make`, `unzip`, C Compiler (`gcc`)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation)
- Clipboard tool (`xclip`/`xsel`/`win32yank` or other depending on platform)
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/): optional, provides various icons
  - if you have it set `vim.g.have_nerd_font` in `init.lua` to true
- Language Setup:
  - If you want to write Typescript, you need `npm`
  - If you want to write Golang, you will need `go`
  - If you want to write Rust, you will need `cargo`
  - etc.

> **NOTE**
> Some plugins require additional dependencies to function. A (mostly complete?)
> list can be found at
> [Additional Dependencies by Plugin](#additional-dependencies-by-plugin)

### Install this Configuration

> **NOTE**
> [Backup](#FAQ) your previous configuration (if any exists)

Neovim's configurations are located under the following paths, depending on your
OS:

| OS | PATH |
| :- | :--- |
| Linux, MacOS | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`, `~/.config/nvim` |
| Windows (cmd)| `%localappdata%\nvim\` |
| Windows (powershell)| `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim\` |

#### Recommended Step

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repo
so that you have your own copy that you can modify, then install by cloning the
fork to your machine using one of the commands below, depending on your OS.

> **NOTE**
> Your fork's url will be something like this:
> `https://github.com/<your_github_username>/nvim-config.git`

You likely want to remove `lazy-lock.json` from your fork's `.gitignore` file
too - it's ignored in the this repo to make maintenance easier, but it's
[recommmended to track it in version control](https://lazy.folke.io/usage/lockfile).

#### Clone the Configuration
> **NOTE**
> If following the recommended step above (i.e., forking the repo), replace
> `Pencilcaseman` with `<your_github_username>` in the commands below

<details><summary> Linux and Mac </summary>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Pencilcaseman/nvim-config.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```

</details>

<details><summary> Windows </summary>

If you're using `cmd.exe`:

```
git clone https://github.com/Pencilcaseman/nvim-config.git "%localappdata%\nvim"
```

If you're using `powershell.exe`

```
git clone https://github.com/Pencilcaseman/nvim-config.git "${env:LOCALAPPDATA}\nvim"
```

</details>

### Post Installation

Start Neovim

```sh
nvim
```

That's it! Lazy will install all the plugins you have. Use `:Lazy` to view
current plugin status. Hit `q` to close the window.

### FAQ

- What if I already have a Neovim configuration installed?
  - You should back up your existing configuration to make sure you can roll
    back if necessary.
  - The easiest way to do this is as follows:

    ```sh
    mv ~/.local/share/nvim{,.bak}
    mv ~/.local/state/nvim{,.bak}
    mv ~/.cache/nvim{,.bak}
    mv ~/.local/share/nvim/mason{,.bak}
    mv ~/.cache/nvim/mason{,.bak}
    ```

- Can I keep my existing configuration in parallel to this configuration?
  - Yes! You can use [NVIM_APPNAME](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#%24NVIM_APPNAME)`=nvim-NAME`
    to maintain multiple configurations. For example, you can install this
    configuration in `~/.config/nvim-pencilcaseman` and create an alias:

    ```sh
    alias nvim-pencilcaseman='NVIM_APPNAME="nvim-pencilcaseman" nvim'
    ```

    When you run Neovim using `nvim-pencilcaseman` alias it will use the
    alternative config directory and the matching local directory
    `~/.local/share/nvim-pencilcaseman`. You can apply this approach to any
    Neovim distribution that you would like to try out.
- What if I want to "uninstall" this configuration:
  - See the above section on having an existing configuration. Removing those
    directories will remove this configuration (be careful not to remove the
    backup!)

### Install Recipes

Below you can find OS specific install instructions for Neovim and dependencies.

After installing all the dependencies continue with the
[Install this Configuration](#install-this-configuration) step.

#### Windows Installation

<details><summary>Windows with Microsoft C++ Build Tools and CMake</summary>
Installation may require installing build tools and updating the run command for
`telescope-fzf-native`

See `telescope-fzf-native` documentation for [more details](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim#installation)

This requires:

- Install CMake and the Microsoft C++ Build Tools on Windows

```lua
{'nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim', build = 'cmake -S. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build --config Release && cmake --install build --prefix build' }
```
</details>
<details><summary>Windows with gcc/make using chocolatey</summary>
Alternatively, one can install gcc and make which don't require changing the config,
the easiest way is to use choco:

1. install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)
either follow the instructions on the page or use winget,
run in cmd as **admin**:
```
winget install --accept-source-agreements chocolatey.chocolatey
```

2. install all requirements using choco, exit previous cmd and
open a new one so that choco path is set, and run in cmd as **admin**:
```
choco install -y neovim git ripgrep wget fd unzip gzip mingw make
```
</details>
<details><summary>WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)</summary>

```
wsl --install
wsl
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/unstable -y
sudo apt update
sudo apt install make gcc ripgrep unzip git xclip neovim
```
</details>

#### Linux Install

sudo mkdir -p /opt/nvim-linux64
sudo chmod a+rX /opt/nvim-linux64
sudo tar -C /opt -xzf nvim-linux64.tar.gz

# make it available in /usr/local/bin, distro installs to /usr/bin
sudo ln -sf /opt/nvim-linux64/bin/nvim /usr/local/bin/
```
